            <p>Hi there! My name is Makia, and I'm an ambitious Front-End Developer located in the States. I have a
                passion
                for
                cultivating responsive,
                user intuitive, well designed web applications. My interest in front-end development peeked after
                discovering
                there was a way to combine my love of visual design and coding. </p>
            <p> Outside of coding, some of my
                interests
                include baking, binge-watching Netflix series, and interior design.
                I'm interested in growing my knowledge across the whole front-end spectrum. If you're interested in
                chatting,
                collaborating, or even studying together feel free to contact me! </p>
